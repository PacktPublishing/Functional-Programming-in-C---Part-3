# Functional Programming in C# - Part 3 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Functional Programming in C# - Part 3 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/functional-programming-c-part-3-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788299305), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Functional programming makes your application faster, improves performance, and increases your productivity. C# code is written at a higher level of abstraction, so that code will be closer to business requirements, abstracting away many low-level implementation details. This video will build on from part 1 and will help you develop a deep understanding of the concepts and practices of LINQ and recursion in C#. You will be introduced to concepts such as lazy evaluation and eager evaluation and will learn about its usage and benefits. From here, you will learn about Monads–the computational builder in Functional Programming and its usage. Going forward, you will learn to build a fully functional app by implementing the concepts learned in both the courses. By the end of the video, you will be able to write code using the best approach and will be able to perform unit testing in functional programming – changing how you write your applications and revolutionizing your projects.
